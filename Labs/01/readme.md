## question # 7
Famous math’s Square roots can also be used to find the distance between two points in a 2-dimensional or 3-
dimensional system for movie or video game production. We have the formula for the distance D between two
points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in 2 dimensions which is given by:
D = √((x2 – x1)^2 + (y2 – y1)^2)
Find the distance D using scratch.
